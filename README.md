# fun-with-dwarven-creationism
So um... yes... um... I want to make world creation creating um... thing.  With direct application to Dwarf Fortress, the idea here is to allow raw files needed for the game to be generatable.  Whether completely random or allowing the user to tweak it as it goes along, the hope is that a successful generation can enable truly unique new worlds to play in.
